\chapter{Ethical considerations}
Our counterfactuals may be biased due to the underlying LLM's biases, and we may not be able to guarantee semantic correctness which may generate a technically incorrect counterfactual. So precautions should be taken to make sure these are used as a tool for further understanding but not as ground truth as with LLMs.

If we evaluate our counterfactual explanations by people rating them we must consider ethical requirements around data collection, privacy, and fairness.
